## Debug Probe Info:
The firmware uf2 file comes from [HERE](https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases/tag/debugprobe-v2.0.1)
using the [debugprobe_on_pico.uf2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases/download/debugprobe-v2.0.1/debugprobe_on_pico.uf2)

for more info see appendix A in the [pico sdk](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#page=68)


Connecting a Standard Pi Pico as the probe to the Maker Pi Pico using this wiring worked, the opposite did not work, also Maker Pi Pico to Maker Pi Pico didn't either.
